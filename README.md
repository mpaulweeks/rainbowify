# rainbowify
canvas experiment

### todo
- pre-compute all images, generate urls, flip through an array
    - should fix flicker on mobile
    - need a way of detecting loop and thus terminating generation
        - or it reaches end then reverses?
    - depending on time to compute, this could support high resolutions?
- ability to upload custom images
- ability to customize size
